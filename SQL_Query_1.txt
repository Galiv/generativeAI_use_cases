I have SQL Server db on Azure Portal. I need to write Write a SQL query to retrieve top 10 best-selling products by revenue, with their corresponding sales revenue and quantity, for each quarter and year.

I need to have a SQL query which performs the necessary data transformations and calculations. The query should return a data set which consists of following columns: [ProductName], [SalesQuantity], [SalesRevenue], [Quarter], [Year] 

ProductName comes as an alias  from table Dimension.StockItem column StockItem. Dimension.StockItem table has a primary key [Stock Item Key]

[SalesQuantity] should come from Fact.Sale table column Quantity.

SalesRevenue should come from Fact.Sale table column Profit.

[Quarter] and [Year] should extract the value from Fact.Sale table date column named InvoiceDateKey.

Dimension.StockItem and Fact Sale should be joined via inner join

ChatGPT
Based on the table structure and your requirements, I suggest the following SQL script. Please note that SQL Server has the DATEPART function, which extracts the part of a date. This function can be used to extract quarter and year from InvoiceDateKey:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    D.StockItem as ProductName, 
    SUM(F.Quantity) as SalesQuantity, 
    SUM(F.Profit) as SalesRevenue,
    DATEPART(QUARTER, F.InvoiceDateKey) as [Quarter],
    DATEPART(YEAR, F.InvoiceDateKey) as [Year]
FROM 
    Dimension.StockItem D 
INNER JOIN 
    Fact.Sale F 
ON 
    D.[Stock Item Key] = F.[Stock Item Key]
GROUP BY 
    D.StockItem, 
    DATEPART(QUARTER, F.InvoiceDateKey),
    DATEPART(YEAR, F.InvoiceDateKey)
ORDER BY 
    SalesRevenue DESC
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY
This SQL statement does the following:

Joins the Dimension.StockItem and Fact.Sale tables on the [Stock Item Key] column.
Groups the data by ProductName, Quarter, and Year.
Summarizes SalesQuantity and SalesRevenue for each product by each Quarter and Year.
Orders the data set by SalesRevenue in descending order.
Returns only the first 10 rows, which correspond to the top 10 best-selling products by revenue.
Please replace the table names, column names, and conditions according to your actual database schema and requirements. If there are any discrepancies, please provide the correct details.
